# nullvariant

## Overview

GitHub profile repository. The `README.md` serves as the public-facing profile page, presenting the nullvariant brand identity, philosophy ("Choose from love, not fear"), and links to key projects. Markdown with embedded HTML/SVG.

## Key Constraints

1. Maintain brand identity consistency — preserve the nullvariant tone, visual style, and messaging.
2. Keep the Bizarre Beast Zoo metaphor (6-persona AI system defined in the self-perfecting-os project) aligned — do not introduce contradictions.
