## Translation Status

**Current State**: CI/CD pipeline is paused while evaluating Claude Sonnet 4.5 for translation.

**Why paused?**
- Rate limit considerations (8,000 tokens/min output limit)
- Quality evaluation in progress
- Manual translation workflow temporarily used

**When will auto-translation resume?**
- After LLM API selection is finalized
- After rate limit handling implementation
- See [ADR-0001](../../docs/decisions/active/2025/10/20251028_0001_ci-cd-pause_architecture.md) for decision details
