## Translation Status

**Current State**: CI/CD pipeline is paused while evaluating Claude Sonnet 4.5 for translation.

**Why is this important?**
- Emotion names carry nuanced cultural meanings
- Japanese → English translation requires careful consideration
- Auto-translation must preserve philosophical intent
