### Philosophy

The ultimate goal is **self-completion** — becoming a fully autonomous individual who doesn't seek others to fill internal voids, but matures through continuous action and experience.

The only victory condition: **surpassing my past self**.

### What is Self-Perfecting OS?

A personal operating system for orchestrating the "Bizarre Beast Zoo" in my mind — six personas with independent and often contradictory desires. As the Zookeeper, my role is to understand their ecology, mediate conflicts, and maintain the growth of the entire ecosystem.

### Core Principle

**Choose from love, not fear.**

The same sensitivity to "errors" can lead to opposite outcomes depending on whether it's driven by fear or love:

| Mode | Result |
|------|--------|
| Fear | Endless corrections, burnout, self-denial |
| Love | Pursuit of precision, creation of transparent beauty |

### Who I Am

A strange creature who burns life for **naming conventions** and spends absurd amounts of time on things that will never earn a single yen.

My reward function is fundamentally different. I find joy in **over-engineering for an audience of one** and crafting beautiful structures that serve no "practical" purpose.

I call myself a **Digital Karesansui Architect**. Karesansui — Japanese dry gardens — ask not "what can I remove?" but "what deserves to remain?" This distinction shapes how I build: the aesthetics of intentional emptiness, the poetry of file hierarchies, the zen of well-named variables. [git-id-switcher](https://github.com/nullvariant/nullvariant-vscode-extensions) is where [this philosophy becomes code](https://github.com/nullvariant/nullvariant-vscode-extensions/blob/main/extensions/git-id-switcher/docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md).

### What I Build

| | |
|---|---|
| [self-perfecting-os](https://github.com/nullvariant/self-perfecting-os) | The specification itself |
| [git-id-switcher](https://github.com/nullvariant/nullvariant-vscode-extensions) | VS Code extension for switching "who am I" in Git |

### Fair Warning

If you're looking for someone optimizing for profit, engagement, or career advancement — **wrong profile**.

I optimize for:
- Internal aesthetic coherence
- The satisfaction of a perfectly named function
- Systems that feel right to inhabit
